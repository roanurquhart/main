== PROJECT: Marketing Morph

---

== Overview

Marketing Morph is a desktop marketing application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is meant to be utilized by a marketing company in order to effectively organize potential targets and potential clients.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to store and manipulate salary, occupation and relationship features for persons in the Addressbook*
** How I did it: I extended the architecture of the Person class and have connected them to the main application.
** What it does: allows the user to record salary, occupation, and relationship attributes for persons, the user can analyze the data for the three attributes.
** Justification: This features improves the product significantly because they provide more comprehensive information of persons in address book, and allow the user to do business analysis, such as analyze salary and occupation for markets.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and required the addition of many new classes and objects. Due to the dense OOP structure of Addressbook Level 4, I had to carefully trace the functionality of my additions throughout the infrastructure in order to implement the person class in the most effective way.
** Credits: The prexisting code base was very useful for guiding my implementation of the three additional person's attributes. It is very clear and comprehensive so I would like to thank the original contributers to this AB4. There is no other outside library applied.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Show the average and median salary for persons through command `averageSalary` and `medianSalary` respectively
** Show the average and median revenue for companies through command `averageRevenue` and `medianRevenue` respectively
** Find persons with exact occupation through `findOccupation`
** Find companies with exact sector through `findSector`
