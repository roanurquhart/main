== PROJECT: Marketing Morph

---

== Overview

Marketing Morph is a desktop application for marketers who want to organize consumer data. And it will allow marketers to use GUI and command lines to keep track of different consumers.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to sort people and export data*
** How I did it: I rewrite the java interface: comparator to implement sorting person/company by any attribute. And I use stream operation to export data.
** What it does: Allow marketers to find their potential clients more convenient, for they can sort clients by their salary and find which person is the best choice. Meanwhile, he/she can export the information of all clients for further analysis, like doing data analysis to find potential clients.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily find a person by sorting them. If he/she wants to find a client with the highest salary, he just need to sort all the clients by reverse order.
** Highlights: Sorting person by any parameters in any order and exporting data to any path.

* *Minor enhancement*: Get the max/min salary of all the clients
